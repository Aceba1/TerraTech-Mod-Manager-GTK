# [TerraTech-Mod-Manager-GTK](https://forum.terratechgame.com/index.php?threads/terratech-mod-manager.17208/)
Recreation of a recreation of a mod manager for [TerraTech](https://terratechgame.com)

## Installing
[Most-recent release](https://github.com/Aceba1/TerraTech-Mod-Manager-GTK/releases/latest)

This requires the mono runtime frameworks meant for your system. You can get that [here](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

(For Windows operating systems, that would be [GTK# for .NET](https://xamarin.azureedge.net/GTKforWindows/Windows/gtk-sharp-2.12.45.msi))

## Note

- Mac support has been added! (ver. [0.3.0](https://github.com/Aceba1/TerraTech-Mod-Manager-GTK/releases/tag/0.3.0))
- Compiling on Linux VSCode produces an executable that does not function on Windows. Visual Studio Community is still necessary.
