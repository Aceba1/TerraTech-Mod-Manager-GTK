# [TerraTech Mod Manager](https://forum.terratechgame.com/index.php?threads/terratech-mod-manager.17208/)
Recreation of a mod manager for [TerraTech](https://terratechgame.com)

## Installing
[Most-recent release](https://github.com/Aceba1/TerraTech-Mod-Manager-GTK/releases/latest)

This requires the mono runtime frameworks meant for your system. **You can get that for your system here: [Mono download site](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).**

(For Windows operating systems, that would be [Mono 32-bit](https://download.mono-project.com/archive/6.6.0/windows-installer/mono-6.6.0.161-gtksharp-2.12.45-win32-0.msi) & [GTK# for .NET](https://xamarin.azureedge.net/GTKforWindows/Windows/gtk-sharp-2.12.45.msi))

(If it does not work for Linux, try to install `mono-complete`)

## Note

- Mac support has been added! (ver. [0.3.0](https://github.com/Aceba1/TerraTech-Mod-Manager-GTK/releases/tag/0.3.0))
- Compiling through Monodevelop might produce an executable that does not function on Windows. Visual Studio Community is still necessary.

- ~~I might try to make a new version next decade in C++~~ It appears that the developers are (finally) working towards official mod support, meaning TTMM may be left behind or integrated.
