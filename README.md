## Installing
[Most-recent release](https://github.com/Aceba1/TerraTech-Mod-Manager-GTK/releases/latest)

This requires the mono runtime frameworks meant for your system. You can get that [here](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

(For Windows operating systems, that would be [GTK# for .NET](https://xamarin.azureedge.net/GTKforWindows/Windows/gtk-sharp-2.12.45.msi))

## Note

- Currently MAC support is *still* being worked on...
